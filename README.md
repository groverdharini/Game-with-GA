Tic Tac Toe - Genetic Algorithm 

A python implementation of Tic Tac Toe using a genetic algorithm to create a lossless game strategy.

What This Code Does?ðŸ˜Ž

The code, prints out an array of 765 pairs of integers. The first column being numbers 1-765 and the second column indicating what state should the player go from the state indicated in the first column. There are other things you could easily print by adding a couple lines to the code. Some of the examples are:

Individuals from each generation
Base Case States
Selected Individuals From Each Generation

What is Genetic Algorithim?ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

Notion of Natural Selection ðŸ™Œ-

The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest individuals from a population. They produce offspring which inherit the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation. If parents have better fitness, their offspring will be better than parents and have a better chance at surviving. This process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found.
This notion can be applied for a search problem. We consider a set of solutions for a problem and select the set of best ones out of them.
Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.

Initial population

Fitness function

Selection

Crossover

Mutation
